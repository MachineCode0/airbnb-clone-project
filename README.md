# Airbnb Clone: Project Overview
A full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, enabling users to browse, book, and list short-term rental properties.

Property Listings: Hosts can add homes with details (photos, pricing, amenities).

Search & Filters: Guests can search by location, dates, price, and property type.

Booking System: Real-time reservations with date conflicts handled.

Reviews & Ratings: Feedback system for guests and hosts.

## üë• **Team Roles**
1. **Backend Developer:** Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
2. **Database Administrator:** Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
3. **DevOps Engineer:** Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
4. **QA Engineer:** Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.


## ‚öôÔ∏è  Technology Stack
1. **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
2. **Django REST Framework:** Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
3. **PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database used for data storage.
4. **GraphQL:** Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
5. **Celery:** For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
6. **Redis:** Used for caching and session management.
7. **Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
8. **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design
1. **User Authentication**
   - **Endpoints:** /users/, /users/{user_id}/
   - **Features:** Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
2. **Property Management**
   - **Endpoints:** /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
   - **Features:** Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
3. **Booking System**
   - **Endpoints:** /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
   - **Features:** Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
4. **Payment Processing**
   - **Endpoints:** /payments/
   - **Features:** Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
5. **Review System**
   - **Endpoints:** /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
   - **Features:** Post and manage reviews for properties.
6. **Database Optimizations**
   - **Indexing:** Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
   - **Caching:** Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.
   - Extensions (Optional)
   - **Messaging:** Host-guest chat.

## Feature Breakdown
- Property Listings: Hosts can add homes with details (photos, pricing, amenities).

- Search & Filters: Guests can search by location, dates, price, and property type.

- Booking System: Real-time reservations with date conflicts handled.

- Reviews & Ratings: Feedback system for guests and hosts.

- Payments: Stripe/PayPal integration.

## API Security Key
1. **Authentication:** Ensures that only verified users can access the API.
    - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** ‚Äì Stateless tokens for session management.
    - **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** ‚Äì For delegated authentication(e.g., Google, Facebook login)
Why? Prevents unauthorized users from accessing restricted endpoints.
2. **Authorization:** Controls what authenticated users can do.
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ‚Äì Grants permissions based on user roles (e.g., Admin, User).
    - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) ‚Äì Fine-grained access based on attributes (e.g., location, department).
    - Policy-Based Access (e.g., OPA, Casbin) ‚Äì Dynamic rule enforcement.
Why? Ensures users only access data and functions they are permitted to.

3. **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Prevents abuse and DDoS attacks.
    - Request Throttling (e.g., 100 requests/minute per user).
    - IP-Based Rate Limiting ‚Äì Blocks excessive requests from a single IP.
    - Token Bucket Algorithm ‚Äì Smoothly controls burst traffic.

Why? Protects against brute-force attacks, scraping, and server overload.

4. **HTTPS & Encryption:** Secures data in transit and at rest.

    - TLS/SSL (HTTPS) ‚Äì Mandatory for all APIs.
    - Data Encryption (AES-256) ‚Äì For sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment details).
    - Hashing (bcrypt, Argon2) ‚Äì Never store plain-text passwords.
Why? Prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and data leaks.

5. **API Gateway & Firewall:** Centralizes security controls.
    - Web Application Firewall (WAF) ‚Äì Blocks SQLi, XSS, DDoS.
    - Reverse Proxy (Nginx, Cloudflare) ‚Äì Filters malicious traffic.
    - API Gateway (Kong, AWS API Gateway) ‚Äì Manages authentication, logging, and rate limiting.
Why? Adds an extra security layer before requests reach the backend.

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview
An automated process that builds, tests, and deploys code changes quickly and safely.

How?

Code is pushed ‚Üí Triggers automation.

Tests run (unit, security, integration).

If tests pass ‚Üí auto-deploy to staging/production.

**Why Use It?**
‚úî Faster releases (no manual errors)
‚úî Fewer bugs (caught early)
‚úî Easy rollbacks if something breaks
‚úî Better teamwork (smooth integrations)

**Popular Tools:**

GitHub Actions, Jenkins (CI/CD)

Docker, Kubernetes (deployment)

Selenium, SonarQube (testing)

Result: Reliable, frequent updates without chaos.

AI Recommendations: Personalized suggestions.
